Code-Refactor project

The goal was to refactor the existing code without changing what it does but only to have more web accessibility.

I updated images to contain alt attributes to be as descriptive as possible.
Also changed some non-semantic elements to semantic elements.

I gave this a unique name in my Github repository.
